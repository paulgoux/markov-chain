Main points for September to November 2019 The UK employment rate was estimated at a record high of 76.3%, 0.6 percentage points higher than a year earlier and 0.5 percentage points up on the previous quarter. The UK unemployment rate was estimated at 3.8%, 0.2 percentage points lower than a year earlier but largely unchanged on the previous quarter. The UK economic inactivity rate was estimated at a record low of 20.6%, 0.4 percentage points lower than the previous year and the previous quarter. Estimated annual growth in average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain remained unchanged at 3.2% for total pay (including bonuses) and slowed to 3.4% from 3.5% for regular pay (excluding bonuses); the annual growth in total pay was weakened by unusually high bonus payments paid in October 2018 compared with more typical average bonus payments paid in October 2019. In real terms (after adjusting for inflation), annual growth in total pay is estimated to be 1.6%, and annual growth in regular pay is estimated to be 1.8%. There were an estimated 805,000 vacancies in the UK for October to December 2019; this is 11,000 fewer than the previous quarter and 49,000 fewer than a year earlier. The data in this bulletin come from surveys of households and businesses. It is not possible to survey every household and business each month, so these statistics are estimates based on samples.

Employment Figure 1: The employment rate for all people increased 0.6 percentage points on the year to a record high of 76.3% UK employment rates (aged 16 to 64 years), seasonally adjusted, January to March 1971 to September to November 2019 Source: Office for National Statistics – Labour Force Survey Employment measures the number of people aged 16 years and over in paid work. The employment rate is the proportion of people aged between 16 and 64 years who are in paid work. Estimated employment rates for people aged between 16 and 64 years have generally been increasing since early 2012 but have levelled off in recent periods (as seen in Figure 1). For September to November 2019: the estimated employment rate for people was a record high of 76.3%; this is 0.6 percentage points up on the year and 0.5 percentage points up on the quarter the estimated employment rate for men was 80.4%; this is 0.1 percentage points up on the year and 0.2 percentage points up on the quarter the estimated employment rate for women was a record high of 72.3%; this is 1.1 percentage points up on the year and a joint record high of 0.7 percentage points up on the quarter The increase in the employment rate for women in recent years is partly a result of changes to the State Pension age for women, resulting in fewer women retiring between the ages of 60 and 65 years. Page 4 of 14 Estimates for September to November 2019 show a record 32.90 million people aged 16 years and over in employment, 359,000 more than a year earlier. This annual increase was mainly driven by full-time workers (up 349,000 on the year to a record high of 24.36 million) and women (up 317,000 on the year to a record high of 15.58 million). The annual increase in women working full-time (up 245,000 to a record high of 9.26 million) was the largest since February to April 2017. More information about employment can be found in the , published alongside this Employment in the UK bulletin release. 4 . Unemployment Figure 2: Unemployment rates have generally been falling for the last six years UK unemployment rates (aged 16 years and over), seasonally adjusted, January to March 1971 to September to November 2019 Source: Office for National Statistics – Labour Force Survey Unemployment measures people without a job who have been actively seeking work within the last four weeks and are available to start work within the next two weeks. The unemployment rate is not the proportion of the total population who are unemployed. It is the proportion of the economically active population (those in work plus those seeking and available to work) who are unemployed. Estimated unemployment rates for both men and women aged 16 years and over have generally been falling since late 2013 but have levelled off in recent periods (as seen in Figure 5). For September to November 2019: Page 5 of 14 the estimated UK unemployment rate for all people was 3.8%, 0.2 percentage points lower than a year earlier but largely unchanged on the previous quarter the estimated UK unemployment rate for men was 4.0%, 0.1 percentage points lower than a year earlier but largely unchanged on the previous quarter the estimated UK unemployment rate for women was 3.6%, down 0.4 percentage points on the year and down 0.1 percentage points on the quarter For September to November 2019, an estimated 1.31 million people were unemployed. This is 64,000 fewer than a year earlier and 618,000 fewer than five years earlier. More information about unemployment can be found in the , published alongside Employment in the UK bulletin this release. 5 . Economic inactivity Figure 3: Overall inactivity rate for people aged between 16 and 64 years was a record low of 20.6%, down 0.4 percentage points on the year UK economic inactivity rate (all people aged 16 to 64 years), seasonally adjusted, January to March 1971 to September to November 2019 Source: Office for National Statistics – Labour Force Survey Page 6 of 14 Economic inactivity measures people without a job but who are not classed as unemployed because they have not been actively seeking work within the last four weeks and/or they are unable to start work within the next two weeks. Our headline measure of economic inactivity is for those aged between 16 and 64 years. Since comparable records began in 1971, the economic inactivity rate for all people aged between 16 and 64 years has been generally falling (although it increased during recessions). This is because of a gradual fall in the economic inactivity rate for women. For people aged between 16 and 64 years, for September to November 2019: the estimated economic inactivity rate for all people was a record low of 20.6%, down 0.4 percentage points on the year and on the quarter the estimated economic inactivity rate for men was 16.2%, largely unchanged on the year but down 0.2 percentage points on the quarter the estimated economic inactivity rate for women was a record low of 24.9%, down 0.8 percentage points on the year and down 0.6 percentage points on the quarter Estimates for September to November 2019 show 8.51 million people aged between 16 and 64 years not in the labour force (economically inactive). This was 145,000 fewer than a year earlier and 587,000 fewer than five years earlier. The annual decrease was driven by women, with the level down 157,000 to reach a record low of 5.18 million. More information about economic inactivity can be found in the , published Employment in the UK bulletin alongside this release. Page 7 of 14 6 . Earnings growth Figure 4: Pay growth for employees (including bonuses) has grown by 1.6% on the year when adjusted for inflation Great Britain average weekly earnings annual growth rates, seasonally adjusted, January to March 2001 to September to November 2019 Source: Office for National Statistics – Monthly Wages and Salaries Survey The earnings estimates are not just a measure of pay rises as they also reflect changes in the number of paid hours worked and changes in the structure of the workforce, for example, more high-paid jobs would have an upward effect on earnings growth rates. The rate of pay growth trended upwards from spring 2017, reaching 3.9% in May to July 2019, the highest nominal pay growth rate since 2008. However, in September to November 2019, growth dropped to 3.2% for total pay and 3.4% for regular pay. The growth in total pay is impacted downwards by unusually high bonuses having been paid in October 2018, whereas those in October 2019 are at more typical levels. In real terms, annual pay growth has been positive since December 2017 to February 2018 and is now 1.6% for total pay (compared with 1.5% last month) and 1.8% for regular pay (unchanged from last month). More information about earnings growth can be found in the Average weekly earnings in Great Britain bulletin, published alongside this release. Page 8 of 14 7 . Vacancies Figure 5: The number of vacancies in the UK has been falling since early 2019 but remains high in historical terms, above 800,000 Number of vacancies in the UK, seasonally adjusted, October to December 2001 to October to December 2019 Source: Office for National Statistics - Vacancy Survey The estimated in the UK fell sharply during the recession of 2008 to 2009. Since 2012, it number of vacancies has generally increased, although it has been falling since early 2019. For October to December 2019, there were an estimated 805,000 vacancies in the UK, 11,000 fewer than for the previous quarter (July to September 2019) and 49,000 fewer than for the previous year. More information about vacancies can be found in the Vacancies and jobs in the UK bulletin, published alongside this release. Page 9 of 14 8 .

Glossary Average weekly earnings Average weekly earnings measures money paid by employers to employees in Great Britain before tax and other deductions from pay. The estimates are not just a measure of pay rises as they also reflect, for example, changes in the overall structure of the workforce. More high-paid jobs in the economy would have an upward effect on the earnings growth rate. Economic inactivity People not in the labour force (also known as ) are not in employment but do not meet the economically inactive internationally accepted definition of unemployment because they have not been seeking work within the last four weeks and/or they are unable to start work in the next two weeks. The economic inactivity rate is the proportion of people aged between 16 and 64 years who are not in the labour force. Employment Employment measures the number of people in paid work, or had a job that they were temporarily away from (for example, because they were on holiday or off sick). This differs from the number of jobs because some people have more than one job. The employment rate is the proportion of people aged between 16 and 64 years who are in employment. A more detailed explanation is available in our . Guide to labour market statistics Unemployment Unemployment measures people without a job who have been actively seeking work within the last four weeks and are available to start work within the next two weeks. The unemployment rate is not the proportion of the total population who are unemployed. It is the proportion of the economically active population (those in work plus those seeking and available to work) who are unemployed. Page 12 of 14 Vacancies Vacancies are defined as positions for which employers are actively seeking recruits from outside their business or organisation. The estimates are based on the Vacancy Survey – a survey of businesses designed to provide estimates of the stock of vacancies across the economy, excluding agriculture, forestry and fishing (a small sector for which the collection of estimates would not be practical). A more detailed is available. Glossary 10 . Measuring the data The employment, unemployment and economic inactivity estimates rely on data collected from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) (a survey run by field interviewers with people across the UK every month). The LFS performance and quality monitoring reports provide data on response rates and other quality related issues for the LFS, including breakdowns of response by LFS wave, region and question-specific response issues. The average weekly earnings and vacancies estimates rely on data collected from surveys of employers. More quality and methodology information on strengths, limitations, appropriate uses, and how the data were created is available in the following QMIs: Labour Force Survey Quality and Methodology Information Average weekly earnings Quality and Methodology Information Vacancy Survey Quality and Methodology Information Upcoming changes The seasonal adjustment parameters used to calculate average weekly earnings (AWE) estimates will be reviewed prior to the next UK labour market release (18 February 2020). This is an annual process, as outlined in the . The review may lead to revisions to the historic AWE time series extending Average weekly earnings QMI back throughout the entire time series. 2021 publication dates 26 January 2021 23 February 2021 23 March 2021 20 April 2021 18 May 2021 15 June 2021 13 July 2021 17 August 2021 14 September 2021 12 October 2021 16 November 2021 14 December 2021 11 . Strengths and limitations Page 13 of 14 Accuracy of the statistics: estimating and reporting uncertainty The figures in this bulletin come from surveys, which gather information from a sample rather than from the whole population. The sample is designed to be as accurate as possible given practical limitations such as time and cost constraints. Results from sample surveys are always estimates, not precise figures. This can have an impact on how changes in the estimates should be interpreted, especially for short-term comparisons. As the number of people available in the sample gets smaller, the variability of the estimates that we can make from that sample size gets larger. Estimates for small groups (for example, unemployed people aged between 16 and 17 years), which are based on quite small subsets of the Labour Force Survey (LFS) sample, are less reliable and tend to be more volatile than for larger aggregated groups (for example, the total number of unemployed people). In general, changes in the numbers (and especially the rates) reported in this bulletin between three-month periods are small, and are not usually greater than the level that can be explained by sampling variability. Short term movements in reported rates should be considered alongside longer-term patterns in the series and corresponding movements in other sources to give a fuller picture. Further information is available in . A guide to labour market statistics Where to find data about uncertainty and reliability Dataset A11 shows sampling variabilities for estimates derived from the LFS. Sampling variability information for average weekly earnings growth rates is available from the “Sampling Variability” worksheets within and . datasets EARN01 EARN03 The sampling variability of the three-month average vacancies level is around plus or minus 1.5% of that level. Information on revisions is available in the labour market statistics revisions policy. Page 14 of 14 12 .

The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a survey of households in the UK. 2. The headline employment rate is the number of people aged 16 to 64 in employment divided by the population aged 16 to 64. 3. The headline unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people (aged 16+) divided by the economically active population (aged 16+). The economically active population is defined as those in employment plus those who are unemployed. 4. The headline inactivity rate is the number of people aged 16 to 64 divided by the population aged 16-64. Note on headline employment, unemployment and inactivity rates The headline employment and inactivity rates are based on the population aged 16 to 64 but the headline unemployment rate is based on the economically active population aged 16 and over. The employment and inactivity rates for those aged 16 and over are affected by the inclusion of the retired population in the denominators and are therefore less meaningful than the rates for those aged from 16 to 64. However, for the unemployment rate for those aged 16 and over, no such effect occurs as the denominator for the unemployment rate is the economically active population which only includes people in work or actively seeking and able to work. Note on headline employment, unemployment and inactivity levels The headline employment and unemployment levels are for those aged 16 and over; they measure all people in work or actively seeking and able to work. However, the headline inactivity level is for those aged 16 to 64. The inactivity rate for those aged 16 and over is less meaningful as it includes elderly people who have retired from the labour force.

These major reclassifications are as follows: Further Education corporations and Sixth Form College corporations in England are included in the private sector from June 2012 but in the public sector for earlier time periods. Royal Mail plc is included in the private sector from December 2013 but in the public sector for earlier time periods. Lloyds Banking Group plc is included in the public sector from December 2008 to December 2013 but in the private sector for earlier and later time periods. Royal Bank of Scotland plc is included in the public sector from December 2008 but in the private sector for earlier time periods. Network Rail is included in the private sector before December 2002. From December 2002 onwards it is included in the public sector (except for the period from June 2003 to March 2004, when it is included in the private sector). Northern Rock is included in the public sector from December 2007 until December 2011 but in the private sector for earlier and later time periods. Bradford and Bingley is included in the public sector from September 2008 but in the private sector for earlier time periods. Welsh Further Education colleges are included in the private sector from March 2015 but in the public sector for earlier time periods. Housing associations in England are included in the public sector between September 2008 and September 2017; they are in the private sector for earlier and later time periods. Housing associations in Scotland are included in the public sector from September 2001 until June 2018; they are included in the private sector for earlier and later time periods. Housing associations in Wales are included in the private sector from June 2018; they are included in the public sector for earlier time periods. Housing associations in Northern Ireland are included in the public sector back to the start of the time series in March 1999. The series shown at Table 4 (in columns 6 to 9) for public and private sector employment excluding the effects of major reclassifications show all of the above mentioned bodies included in the private sector for all time periods and excluded from the public sector for all time periods. When using figures from this table, the latest estimate of the number of people employed in the public and private sectors should be taken from columns 1 and 3 respectively. However the quarterly and annual changes in employment shown in these columns are affected by reclassifications. Figures from columns 6 and 8 should be used for assessments of the recent underlying changes in public and private sector employment. The changes in employment shown in these columns are measured on a consistent basis to remove the effect of major reclassifications. 1. Estimated as the difference between LFS total employment and the data from public sector organisations. 2. LFS employment data for March refer to February-April, June refers to May-July, September refers to August-October and December refers to November-January. 3. This series excludes locally engaged staff stationed outside the United Kingdom.

Labour market statistics enquiries: labour.market@ons.gov.uk (*) Note: The UK rates shown in this table are as published by EUROSTAT (the EUs statistical office). See Table 1 for the latest rates for the UK as published by ONS. 1. All employment rates shown in this table are for those aged from 15 to 64 except for the rate for the United States published by OECD which are for those aged from 16 to 64. 2. The employment rates for the EU are published by EUROSTAT and are not seasonally adjusted. EUROSTAT do not publish seasonally adjusted (SA) employment rates but SA rates for some EU countries are published by OECD. These OECD employment rates are available on our website at dataset A10. 3. Unemployment rates published by EUROSTAT for most EU countries (but not for the UK), are calculated by extrapolating from the most recent LFS data using monthly registered unemployment data. A standard population basis (15-74) is used by EUROSTAT except for Spain, Italy and the UK (16-74). The unemployment rate for the US is based on those aged 16 and over, but the rates for Canada and Japan are for those aged 15 and over. All unemployment rates shown in this table are seasonally adjusted. 4. The "Total EU" series consist of all 28 EU countries. The Eurozone figures consist of the following EU countries: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia and Spain. 5. The EU unemployment rates are as published on the EUROSTAT database. For Sweden the rates on the database differ from those shown in the EUROSTAT News Release published on 09 January 2020. This is because the figures for Sweden on the database are seasonally adjusted estimates but the figures for Sweden shown in the News Release are the trend component. 18 Labour disputes Working days lost (thousands) 1,2 Working days lost in the Public Sector (thousands)1,2 Working days lost in the Private Sector (thousands)1,2 Number of stoppages3 Number of stoppages in the Public Sector Number of stoppages in the Private Sector Workers involved (thousands)1,3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 BBFW F8XZ F8Y2 BLUU F8Y3 F8Y4 BLUT 2017 November 8 0 8 11 1 10 3 2018 November 11 0 11 8 1 7 3 December 5 1 5 7 2 5 1 2019 January 11 1 11 10 2 8 6 February 7 2 5 11 5 6 6 March 9 1 8 14 6 8 5 April 2 1 2 8 1 7 1 May 10 1 10 14 2 12 5 June 12 1 12 24 5 19 3 July 11 4 7 24 9 15 7 August 7 1 6 10 2 8 2 September 9 1 8 14 3 11 3 October 8 1 7 10 4 6 2 November (p) 83 14 68 12 4 8 19 Cumulative totals 12 months to: Nov 18 277 30 248 85 26 59 42 Nov 19 (p) 175 27 147 98 28 70 40 Relationship between columns 1=2+3; 4=5+6 Data source: ONS Labour Disputes Survey Labour disputes enquiries 01633 455400 1. Estimates of working days lost and workers involved are shown to the nearest thousand. Unrounded estimates of less than 500 therefore round to zero. 2. Due to rounding the working days lost for the public and private sectors may not add up to the total working days lost. 3. The latest 12 month cumulative totals for the figures in these columns will not necessarily equal the sum of the 12 months as some disputes continue for over one month. These disputes appear in each month's data, but only once in the total.
